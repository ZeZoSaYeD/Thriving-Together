  "autismSpectrumDisorderTitle": "Autism Spectrum Disorder : ",
  "autismDefinition": "Autism or Autism Spectrum Disorder is one of a group of developmental disorders known in our society as Autism Spectrum Disorders. It typically appears during infancy, usually before the age of three. While the severity and symptoms of autism vary significantly from case to case, all autism spectrum disorders affect a child's ability to communicate, interact with others, and form mutual relationships.",

  "prevalenceAndDiagnosisTitle": "Prevalence and Diagnosis",
  "prevalenceText": "Estimates indicate that 6 out of every 1,000 children in the United States are diagnosed with autism, with a steady increase in diagnosed cases. It remains unclear whether this rise is due to improved diagnostic methods and awareness, an actual increase in prevalence, or a combination of factors. Although there is currently no cure for autism, intensive treatments and early diagnosis can significantly improve the quality of life for children with this disorder.",

  "coreDevelopmentalChallengesTitle": "Core Developmental Challenges",
  "coreChallengesIntro": "Children with autism often show challenges in three main developmental areas:",
  "socialInteraction": "1. Social Interaction:",
  "socialInteractionText": "Difficulty in establishing reciprocal social relationships.",
  "languageasd": "2. Language:",
  "languageText": "Delayed or impaired communication abilities.",
  "behavior": "3. Behavior:",
  "behaviorText": "Repetitive behaviors and limited interests.",

  "developmentalProgression": "As children with autism grow older, some may develop better social skills and show fewer behavioral difficulties, even living relatively normal lives. However, others may continue to face challenges in language skills and social interaction, and behavioral difficulties may worsen over time. Some children with autism learn slowly, while others have average or above-average intelligence. These children may learn quickly but struggle to apply their knowledge in daily life or adapt to different situations. A small group of individuals with autism show exceptional skills in specific areas such as art, mathematics, or musicâ€”they are called 'autistic savants'.",

  "autismSymptomsTitle": "Symptoms of Autism",
  "symptomsIntro": "The signs and symptoms of autism vary widely, with each individual displaying unique behaviors and skills. However, severe cases are often characterized by an inability to communicate and form social relationships.",

  "commonSymptomsTitle": "Common Symptoms:",

  "behavioralPatterns": "3. Behavioral Patterns:",
  "behavioralPatternsList": "* Engages in repetitive motions such as rocking, spinning, or hand flapping.\n* Develops specific routines and rituals, resisting any changes.\n* Displays hyperactivity or inability to remain still.\n* Fixates on particular object details, such as spinning wheels on a toy car.\n* Exhibits hypersensitivity to sensory input, such as light or sound, while being seemingly indifferent to pain.",

  "youngChildrenNote": "Some young children struggle to share experiences with others or adapt to changes in their environment.",

  "causesAndRiskFactorsTitle": "Causes and Risk Factors of Autism",
  "causesIntro": "The exact cause of autism remains unclear, though research suggests that a combination of genetic and environmental factors plays a significant role.",

  "geneticFactors": "Genetic Factors:",
  "geneticFactorsText": "Researchers have identified several genes potentially associated with autism. Some of these genes increase susceptibility to the disorder, while others influence brain development and connectivity between neurons. Genetic mutations may be inherited or occur spontaneously.",

  "environmentalFactors": "Environmental Factors:",
  "environmentalFactorsText": "Many health conditions result from an interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Researchers are exploring whether viral infections or environmental toxins may contribute to autism.",

  "additionalTheories": "Additional Theories:",
  "additionalTheoriesText": "Other potential contributors under investigation include complications during childbirth and the role of the immune system in autism. Some researchers also suggest that damage to the amygdala, a brain region associated with emotional regulation, may be a factor.",

  "complicationsTitle": "Complications:",
  "complicationsIntro": "Autism can lead to challenges in several areas of life, including:",
  "complicationsList": "* Academic difficulties.\n* Social isolation.\n* Inability to live independently.\n* Increased stress.\n* Risk of abuse or mistreatment.",

  "diagnosisTitle": "Diagnosis:",
  "diagnosisIntro": "Diagnosing autism involves:",
  "diagnosisList": "* A clinical evaluation of the child by a specialist.\n* Discussions with parents about the child's social, linguistic, and behavioral development.\n* A series of tests to assess communication, language, and psychological aspects.\n* While initial signs may appear before 18 months, a definitive diagnosis is often made between ages 2 and 3, when developmental delays in language and social interaction become more apparent. Early diagnosis is critical, as intervention before age 3 significantly improves outcomes.",

  "languageDisordersTitle": "Language Disorders",
  "languageTitle":"Language :",
  "languageDefinition": "Language is a universal symbolic system used for communication. This system is globally agreed upon and involves assigning meanings to sounds, words, gestures, and other symbols (Al-Khatib & Al-Hadidi, 2009).",
  
  "typesOfLanguageDisordersTitle": "Types of Language Disorders",
  "languageDisordersClassification": "Language disorders are classified into five main types:",
  
  "phonologicalDisordersTitle": "Phonological Disorders (Sound System):",
  "phonologicalDisordersText": "This pertains to the phonology (sound system) of language, including the rules governing the formation or combination of different sounds. The phonological level varies depending on the language used.",
  
  "morphologicalDisordersTitle": "Morphological Disorders (Word Structure):",
  "morphologicalDisordersText": "This refers to the set of rules governing word components that form the basic elements of meaning and word structure. Prefixes, suffixes, or other morphological changes can alter the meanings of specific words.",
  
  "syntacticDisordersTitle": "Syntactic Disorders (Word Order and Sentence Structure):",
  "syntacticDisordersText": "This focuses on word order in sentences. As with phonological rules, syntactic structures differ between languages. For example, the way negative sentences are formed in English differs from Spanish or French.",
  
  "semanticDisordersTitle": "Semantic Disorders (Word and Sentence Meaning):",
  "semanticDisordersText": "These disorders involve delays in acquiring specific word meanings or relationships between words. Typically, this delay follows normal language acquisition patterns. If untreated, these challenges may persist into adolescence.",
  
  "pragmaticDisordersTitle": "Pragmatic Disorders (Social Use of Language):",
  "pragmaticDisordersText": "This aspect relates to an individual's ability to use language effectively for communication in different social contexts. Pragmatics focuses on the meaning and intent of communication within its context (Al-Zriqat, 2005).",
  
  "diagnosisMethodsTitle": "Language Disorder Diagnosis Methods",
  "diagnosisMethodsText": "Diagnosing language disorders involves collecting individual history, direct clinical observation in various contexts (e.g., home, school, or workplace), and results from standardized language assessments. These assessments help evaluate symptom severity and support diagnosis. A positive family history of language disorders often reinforces the diagnosis (Faqiri & Awad, 2016). Children or individuals with language disorders may be shy or reserved in conversations, preferring to communicate only with family members or familiar people.",
  
  "recommendationTitle": "Recommendation",
  "recommendationText": "Families with children experiencing one or more language disorders are encouraged to seek appropriate therapeutic interventions to prevent worsening problems and future treatment difficulties.",
  
  "speechDisordersTitle": "Speech Disorders",
  "speechDisordersIntro": "People without disabilities rely heavily on verbal communication methods to share their thoughts and feelings with others and acquire new information through their interactions. Speech disorders vary by gender, type, age, and environment. Some disorders, such as stuttering, increase in prevalence with age. These disorders arise from speech errors caused by improper sequential use of jaw and lip movements, as noted by Al-Khatib and Al-Hadidi (2009).",
  
  "speechDisordersDefinition": "Speech disorders include difficulties in producing sounds correctly, which may hinder verbal communication.",

  "environmentalFactors": "Environmental Factors:",
  "environmentalFactorsText": "Lack of linguistic interaction or neglect",
  
  "typesOfChildSpeechDisordersTitle": "Types of Speech Disorders in Children",
  "substitutionTitle": "1. Substitution:",
  "substitutionText": "This occurs when a child replaces one sound with another. For example, a child might replace the 'R' sound with 'L,' saying 'lajl' instead of 'rajl' (man). Sound substitution is one of the most common speech disorders among children, especially up to age six.",
  "omissionTitle": "2. Omission:",
  "omissionText": "In this case, the child omits one or more sounds from a word. Typically, the omitted sound is the last sound of the word, which may make the word incomprehensible unless placed in a familiar sentence or context. Omission makes it difficult to understand the child's speech and identify their needs or ideas, affecting communication.",
  "additionTitle": "3. Addition:",
  "additionText": "This involves the child adding an extra sound to a word, making their speech unclear and hard to understand. If this problem persists, it may lead to long-term speech difficulties.",
  "distortionTitle": "4. Distortion:",
  "distortionText": "Here, the child produces sounds similar to those made by people without speech disorders but incorrectly. The sound deviates from its correct articulation point, and the child uses improper airflow methods to produce the sound.",
  
  "diagnosisTitle": "Diagnosing Speech Disorders",
  "diagnosisText": "The diagnostic process involves several steps, beginning with assessment. The specialist starts by reviewing the child's case history.",
